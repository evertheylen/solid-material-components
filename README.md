# Solid Material Components

Port of [Material Design Components](https://material.io/components/) for [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/). In the future, self-made components could be provided.

## Status

This library is a work in progress. I will add components as I need them myself. Released components should be perfectly usable, but API changes may happen.

## Usage

**Currently only supports usage with vite. A separate package will be released in a more traditional
way that's usable in all circumstances.**

  - Install `pnpm add solid-material-components`
  - No need to import any CSS (thanks to vite)!
  - Optionally import the icon font by placing the following in your `<head>` tag:
    `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons">`
  - Just import components and use them. For example:

    ```
    import 
    ```

## TODOs

  - [ ] (better) global theming solution
  - [ ] non-vite package
  - [ ] online demo page
  - [ ] more components!
