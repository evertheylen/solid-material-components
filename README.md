# Solid Material Components

Port of [Material Design Components](https://material.io/components/) for [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/). In the future, self-made components could be provided.

## Status

This library is a work in progress. I will add components as I need them myself. Released components should be perfectly usable, but API changes may happen.

## Setup

Just install it and import things!

## Theming

Like this:

```jsx
import { useTheme } from "solid-material-components/theme";

document.body.style = useTheme({primary: "#ff0000", /* etc */});
```
